# ECDC models submitted to forecasting hubs
Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by the ECDC Mathematical Modelling team for the various forecasting hubs. 

## Running all forecasting models
`main.R` in this folder will run all models for all currently active hubs. Output will be stored in `üìÅmodel_output` and is ready for submission via the appropriate github repositories.

## Overview of forecasting models
### SARIMA
 A simple ARIMA model with seasonality

 **Sumbitting to**: COVID19 hub

### ARI2MA
An ARIMA model with seasonality and with sqrt transformed data

**Sumbitting to**: RespiCast - ARI

### FluForARIMA
A simple ARIMA model with seasonality. 

**Sumbitting to**: RespiCast - ILI

### SOCA Simplex
Using historical data patterns with highest similarity to current data to foreast the future values

**Sumbitting to**: RespiCast - ILI, RespiCast - ARI, COVID19 hub
