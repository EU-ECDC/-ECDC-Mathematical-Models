# ECDC models submitted to forecasting hubs
Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by the ECDC Mathematical Modelling team for the various forecasting hubs. 

## Running all forecasting models
`00_main.R` in this folder will run all models for all currently active hubs. Output will be stored in `üìÅmodel_output` and is ready for submission via the appropriate github repositories.

## Overview of forecasting models
### ARIMA
 A simple ARIMA model with seasonality
**Sumbitting to**: RespiCast - ILI, ARI, COVID-19

### SOCA Simplex
Using historical data patterns with highest similarity to current data to foreast the future values

**Sumbitting to**: RespiCast - ILI, ARI, COVID-19
