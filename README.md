## Welcome to the ECDC Mathematical Modelling Team's GitHub repository!

Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by the ECDC Mathematical Modelling team for various purposes, for example forecasting respiratory disease indicators (influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and indicators related to COVID-19 ).\

This repository is structured using the following folders:

### "RespiCast_models"

**Containing models submitted to [RespiCast](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/)**

-   *ARI2MA*: This ARIMA model for ARIs utilizes a square-root transformation on the data and incorporates seasonality terms.
-   *FluForARIMA*: This is an ARIMA model with seasonality terms that forecasts ILIs.

### "Covid19-hub_models"

**Models submitted to the [Covid-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/)**

-   *SARIMA*: This is an ARIMA model with seasonality terms that forecasts COVID-19 cases, deaths, and hospitalisations.

### "Scenario-hub_models"

**Models submitted to [Covid-19 Scenario Hub](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/)**
