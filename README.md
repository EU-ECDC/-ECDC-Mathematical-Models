# Welcome to the ECDC Mathematical Modelling Team's GitHub repository!

Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by the ECDC Mathematical Modelling team for various purposes, for example forecasting respiratory disease indicators (influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and indicators related to COVID-19 ).\
\
This repository is structured using the following folders:

## `Forecasting-hubs_models`

**Containing models submitted to any of the forecasting hubs:** [RespiCast](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/) and [Covid-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/)**

## `Scenario-hub_models`

**Models submitted to [Covid-19 Scenario Hub](https://covid19scenariohub.eu/)**
