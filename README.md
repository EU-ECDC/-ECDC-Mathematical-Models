## Welcome to the ECDC Mathematical Modelling Team's GitHub repository! 

Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by our team for various purposes, 
including forecasting for several respiratory disease indicators, such as influenza-like-illness (ILI), 
acute respiratory infection (ARI), and indicators related to COVID-19.

### Models submitted to [RespiCast](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/)

- ARI2MA: This ARIMA model for ARIs utilizes a square-root transformation on the data and incorporates seasonality terms.
- FluForARIMA: This is an ARIMA model with seasonality terms that forecasts ILIs
