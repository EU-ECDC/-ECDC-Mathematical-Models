# Welcome to the ECDC Mathematical Modelling Team's GitHub repository!

Here you will find a collection of mathematical models developed by the ECDC Mathematical Modelling team for various purposes, for example forecasting respiratory disease indicators (influenza-like-illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), and indicators related to COVID-19 ).\
\
This repository is structured using the following folders:

## `Forecasting-hubs_models`

**Containing models submitted to any of the forecasting hubs:** [RespiCast](https://respicast.ecdc.europa.eu/) (and to the now retired [Covid-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/))

## `Scenario-hub_models`
currently empty, but is ready for models submitted to ECDC scenario hubs (e.g. RespiCompass)
