name: GenerateModelOutput 

# This example workflow is meant to depict steps needed to run R or Python code 
# from a tools repository saving the output data to another data repository 
# A good starting point for a better understandig of how GitHub actions work
# is this: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart


# Firts step is to define di events that can trigger this workflow
on:

  # You can trigger the workflow at a scheduled time 
  schedule:
    # runnit it every Tue at 6.00 pm
    - cron: "00 18 * * 2"

  
  # Or you can manually trigger the workflow
  workflow_dispatch:


# then you need to define the flow of your jon step by step    
jobs:

  # here we need a single job, running on a standard Ubuntu virtual machine
  main_job:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:

    # Checkout the GitHub tools repo where R 
    # scripts used to run your model resides
    # In this example tools repo is https://github.com/EU-ECDC/ECDC-Mathematical-Models
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------------      
    - name: checkout ECDC Mathematical Models repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        repository: 'EU-ECDC/ECDC-Mathematical-Models'
        ref: 'main'  # the git branch to work on
        path: './models'  # Relative path under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE to place the repository


    # Set up an R environment, with needed dependencies
    # e.g. some GitHub hosted package or "jsonlite" package
    # ----------------------------------------------------------------
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
      with:
        install-r: false

    - name: Installing dependencies
      run: |
        install.packages("summarytools")
      shell: Rscript {0}

    # Now you can run your R script from "R-code" folder under tools repo
    # The --hub_path parameter is passed so that you can use it inside your script  
    # to write the output into the data-repo
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------
    - name: do the R stuff
      id: do_R_stuff
      run: |
        # call R script from tools
        # Rscript ./models/Forecasting-hubs_models/00_main.R  --hub_path "./repo"
        cd ./models/Forecasting-hubs_models
        Rscript 00_main.R


    # Finally, when you are done with your model processign, 
    # commit changes to the data-repo 
    - name: Commit data repo changes
